          <p>
              TemperateReefBase is a resource for temperate reef
              researchers worldwide to use and contribute data. Unique
              in its role as a one-stop-shop for global temperate reef
              data, TemperateReefBase was initially established by
              IMAS in collaboration with the Kelp Ecology Ecosystem
              Network (KEEN).
          </p>
          <p>
              KEEN was instigated through a National Centre for
              Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) working group
              which assembled experts from around the world to examine
              the impacts of global change on kelp-bed ecosystem
              worldwide. The group has assembled significant global
              data for kelps, other seaweeds and associated species
              including fishes, and has embarked on unprecedented
              global experiments and surveys in which identical
              experiments and surveys are being conducted at sites in
              kelp beds around the world to determine global trends
              and examine the capacity of kelps to respond to
              disturbance in the face of climate change and other
              anthropogenic stressors.

          <p>
              The TemperateReefBase Data Portal is an online interface
              showcasing the metadata catalogue and all contributed
              temperate reef data. The portal aims to make this data
              freely and openly available for the benefit of marine
              and environmental science as a whole.
          </p>

          <p>
              The TemperateReefBase Data Portal is hosted and
              maintained by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic
              Studies at the University of Tasmania, Australia.
